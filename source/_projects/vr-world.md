## What I have built for NCTech's VR.World

I've been a senior member in the Backend development team, developing APIs, OAuth systems, KPI calculation systems
and more.

I've been actively involved also into integrating the platform with Google Street View services.

## What can VR.World do for you?

With automatic big data processing, you’ll have access to all the tools you’ll need to process, analyse and distribute your content. 
VR.World also offers FREE hosting and distribution for 360 º panoramic images from almost any camera, plus one of the 
most competitive processing and distribution platforms in the world.

## The Platform

The purpose built platform makes it easy for customers to publish and share their data using the very latest VR, AR and processing technology. 
Capture, upload, process, review and share from one handy platform, anywhere and anytime.

## Image Processing

VR.World is a purpose built open cloud platform that provides processing,
analysis and understanding of vast amounts of data to our global partners.

The large volume of data passing through VR.World allows for the most competitive processing and distribution platform for NCTech's clients. 
VR.World can also publish customers' processed data directly to other platforms such as Google Street View.
