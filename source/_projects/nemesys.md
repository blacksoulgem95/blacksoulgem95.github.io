## What I've done

I've been actively involved into creating state machines and rest APIs for the core functionality of the system. 

## About the project

The project aims to design and develop an innovative platform, based on cloud computing infrastructure, to support
businesses and business combinations in the phases of collaboration and business management. The primary focus is on the
optimization of business processes by digitizing them and supporting the marketing and commercialization activities of
companies, with a view to national market and internationalization, through a single access point that also favors the
exchange of documents and communications in total safety and compliance with current legislation.
