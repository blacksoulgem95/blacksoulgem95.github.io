PKPass Loader is a webapp to load a PKPass to your Apple Wallet.

Sometimes, some websites make you download PKPasses, but don't mail them, and if you're on your desktop, you can't easily
move them to your iPhone's wallet. 

This webapp solves exactly this problem: copy the file to your iPhone storage, upload to the website and it will be
loaded to your Apple Wallet.
