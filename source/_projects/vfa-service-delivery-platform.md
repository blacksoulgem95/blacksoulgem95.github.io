## What I've built for Service Delivery Platform

While working at [WebSite srl](https://websiteitalia.com), we as a Software House were involved into creating this
Apache-camel based service integration platform that could help in the communication between every piece of software VFA has.

I've been actively involved into the making of various Camel routes, integrating and converting messages between 
services, but also in the development of the SDP system front-end, that allows VFA to control all their services.

## What SDP is

Vodafone Automotive needed a platform to make the most of their potential, to build on its technological assets and allow to anticipate market opportunities, continuously enriching the offer.

Fundamental requirements of the service delivery platform were:

- possibility to integrate with other systems (telematic platforms, order management, administration and accounting, â€¦)
- ability to create B2B interconnections with business customers platforms
- orchestration of the entire configuration process of telematic services
- easy evolution in terms of new features, opening of new domestic and international markets
- continuity of service
- scalability
