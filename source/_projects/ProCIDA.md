## What I've done

I've been actively involved into creating state machines and rest APIs for the user data management of the system.

## About the project

Pro.C.I.D.A. â€“ Project for Certified Identity in the Digital Agenda - was born from the need to make available a new
generation of services based on innovative mechanisms for the identification of users and their secure access to online
services, with the aim of promoting digital cooperation between PA, businesses and citizens, organizations and
individuals. The project was approved under the "Insieme x Vincere" Regional Operational Program, co-financed by the
European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), under Axis I "Research, Innovation and Strengthening of the production base"
