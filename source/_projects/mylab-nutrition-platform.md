## What is MyLab Nutrition

MyLab Nutrition was born in 2018 from the dream of [Gianluca Perra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gianlucaperra)
to bring into the supplements market an innovative solution to create completely personalised formulas.

Gianluca, coming from the experience he has since 2016 with his brand **T-Rex Integratori**, together with
[Daniele Fumi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielefumi/) proposed the project
to [LVenture Group](https://lventuregroup.com?utm_source=italianprogrammer.pizza)
and got a seed round to start off the company.

I still remember in January 2018 the call I've received from Daniele about joining in the project, and I accepted it
with no hesitation.

## What I've developed 

I've built the whole website, from backend to frontend and, together with Gianluca and medical experts we've developed
the **first version** of the Supplement Suggestion A.I. (which, at the time, was not yet a full-fledged A.I.).

I had to setup the entire company IT Security Policies, PBX systems, Servers, Emails, SMS Delivery - 
essentially, every kind of software you might think a company needs, I've set it up.

I've managed a few freelance developers who helped in the rebranding of the website, before my departure in late 2018.
