Sofia is an able programmer with a rare combination of **patience**, **learning** and **analytical skills**. 
She has worked with me as **full stack developer** into 2 project, during which I was the PM. 
As a colleague and team member she was a **master in coding**. 
Iâ€™m happy with the work Sofia did, and I would **truly recommend her**.
