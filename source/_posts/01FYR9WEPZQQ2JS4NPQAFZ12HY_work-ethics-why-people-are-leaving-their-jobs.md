No one wants to work anymore - actually, no one ever wanted to lose their personal time for someone else's profit.

We are seeing everywhere in the globe an actual crisis on finding workers, but why's that? Well, if you're asking
yourself this question, you might be one of the problems.

## What workers get

In most cases, people get a horrible work-life balance, an unsupportive employer and feel like cogs in a mechanism.

They feel worthless to themselves because of work, not being able to spend time with their families and loved ones
because they have to work, or because anxiety from work.

A lot of people get on their hands too much work for what their mind can handle - even though their body might handle
more; but we forget to remember that the most saturating stress is the mental one.

Having to commute 1, 2, 3 hours per day, and losing this time in traffic or on public transit, instead of actually
enjoying some time for yourself, will cause a mental breakdown at some point in your life.

And if this stress is not enough, people face Queerphobic employers and coworkers, hazing, disrespect and harassment.

### And there is even more!

Do you know the struggle of not being able to afford a house even if you work 2 full time jobs? This causes serious
mental problems and breakdowns, leading to workers to feel miserable and useless to the society.

Not being able to afford housing, food and care for your children, on a full time job, should not be the norm and yet it
is in today's society.

And if you deep dive even more, you'd find consultancy companies, where literally what in Italy is called "Body-Rental"
happens: one company that makes mass-hiring of various figures and rents them to other companies. And no, "PaaS"
(Person as a Service), will not help your company, it will only ruin your reputation.

I wrote in the past an article that might help
you [understand how to improve your employees' life](/2022/02/09/inclusive-policies-for-the-21st-century-workplace/).

Because, if a job can't provide me with the security I need, why should I even bother losing my time for it?
