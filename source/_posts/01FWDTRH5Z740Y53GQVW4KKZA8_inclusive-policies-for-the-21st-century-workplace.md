In the modern era more than ever there is the need to write inclusive policies to help the workforce feel safe in the working environment.

Let me share a few "draft" policies that should be embraced by all companies worldwide.

## Name Policy

The name of an individual is a **core part of their identity** and their personality, 
and everyone should be allowed to choose their elected name to use for work.

In particular for transgender people this is important as using the **deadname** is extremely **painful** for them - 
it causes extreme **discomfort** if not even **depression**.

It is important to allow people to have **emails, accounts and documents in their elected name**, whenever possibile, 
and to reclude the "legal" name to only situation in which is strictly required.

## Bathroom policy

**Everyone should be able to use the bathroom they feel more comfortable in**, 
transgender women should be allowed in women only spaces and transgender men should be allowed in men only spaces.

Cis-women who are afraid of trans-women in women spaces are actually afraid of men, without understanding 
that trans-women are women too and are afraid of men too.

Allowing this fear to drive the "bathroom policy" and not allowing trans people in their true gender's 
bathroom only **allows transphobia to proliferate and discriminates even further a marginalised group of society**.

Is also important to provide **gender-neutral bathrooms** where anyone can enter **without discrimination**, 
this will not only help gender non-conforming and gender-questioning people, but also help **eradicate the fear of a predator being in a bathroom**.

If there's space, consider also adding a **shower room** to allow people who come with bicycles, 
walking or other body-intensive activity, to take a shower and change their clothes before starting to work.

## Discrimination policy

**Discrimination in the workplace reduces revenue**. Every business owner should know that. 
Any employee who discriminate based on sex, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, 
gender identity and/or disability should face serious consequences: if they're left doing harm, 
they will make your workforce flee to the competition, and with them, your business secrets.

I have personally heard stories of bosses saying to their employees stuff like 
"_**You should not come out in the office, it is like coming with a purple crest on your hair**_" 
at a transgender woman who just had the courage to assert her identity in the workplace. 
This has caused **serious depression** to the poor woman, 
and felt like **nobody cared about her** and that she should just **leave the company**.

## Childcare policy

Unfortunately, non married couples, LGBTQIA+ couples or polyamorous polycules **do not get legal recognition of their children**, 
if they were not "actively" involved into making them (adoption, foster care, IVF, etc...).

An **inclusive company should recognise** this and help those families by recognising those 
children that the law won't recognise. Give your employees the **right to time off to take care of their children**, 
to bring them or take them from school and other activities, as if they were legally recognised by law, 
this will allow for a happier and healthier workplace.

## Education policy

All **employees and business owners** should be educated about **what being LGBTQIA+ means**, 
especially about trans people. There's still a lot of **stigma** around transgender people, 
thinking that transgender people are only female looking **AMAB** individuals who performs the oldest job in the world. 
There is also a lot of **confusion** about the difference between a **drag queen**, a **transgender woman** and a **transvestite**:


1. a Transgender woman is a woman, period.
2. a Drag Queen is a character, non the person behind the character, who performs with extreme makenpm rup and dresses.
3. a Transvestite, or crossdresser, is a person who enjoys dressing in what is considered other gender's clothes, 
   this could be a man, knowing he is a man, with feminine clothes or a woman, knowing she is a woman, with masculine clothes.
