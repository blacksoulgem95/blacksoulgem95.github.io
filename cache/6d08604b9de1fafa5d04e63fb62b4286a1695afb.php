<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><h2>What is MyLab Nutrition</h2>

<p>MyLab Nutrition was born in 2018 from the dream of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gianlucaperra">Gianluca Perra</a>
to bring into the supplements market an innovative solution to create completely personalised formulas.</p>

<p>Gianluca, coming from the experience he has since 2016 with his brand <strong>T-Rex Integratori</strong>, together with
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielefumi/">Daniele Fumi</a> proposed the project
to <a href="https://lventuregroup.com?utm_source=italianprogrammer.pizza">LVenture Group</a>
and got a seed round to start off the company.</p>

<p>I still remember in January 2018 the call I've received from Daniele about joining in the project, and I accepted it
with no hesitation.</p>

<h2>What I've developed</h2>

<p>I've built the whole website, from backend to frontend and, together with Gianluca and medical experts we've developed
the <strong>first version</strong> of the Supplement Suggestion A.I. (which, at the time, was not yet a full-fledged A.I.).</p>

<p>I had to setup the entire company IT Security Policies, PBX systems, Servers, Emails, SMS Delivery - 
essentially, every kind of software you might think a company needs, I've set it up.</p>

<p>I've managed a few freelance developers who helped in the rebranding of the website, before my departure in late 2018.</p>
