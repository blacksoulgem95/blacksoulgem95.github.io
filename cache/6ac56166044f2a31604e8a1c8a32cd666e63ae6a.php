<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><h2>What I've built for Service Delivery Platform</h2>

<p>While working at <a href="https://websiteitalia.com">WebSite srl</a>, we as a Software House were involved into creating this
Apache-camel based service integration platform that could help in the communication between every piece of software VFA has.</p>

<p>I've been actively involved into the making of various Camel routes, integrating and converting messages between 
services, but also in the development of the SDP system front-end, that allows VFA to control all their services.</p>

<h2>What SDP is</h2>

<p>Vodafone Automotive needed a platform to make the most of their potential, to build on its technological assets and allow to anticipate market opportunities, continuously enriching the offer.</p>

<p>Fundamental requirements of the service delivery platform were:</p>

<ul>
<li>possibility to integrate with other systems (telematic platforms, order management, administration and accounting, â€¦)</li>
<li>ability to create B2B interconnections with business customers platforms</li>
<li>orchestration of the entire configuration process of telematic services</li>
<li>easy evolution in terms of new features, opening of new domestic and international markets</li>
<li>continuity of service</li>
<li>scalability</li>
</ul>
