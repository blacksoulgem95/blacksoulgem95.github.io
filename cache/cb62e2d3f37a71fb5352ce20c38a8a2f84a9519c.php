<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>In the modern era more than ever there is the need to write inclusive policies to help the workforce feel safe in the working environment.</p>

<p>Let me share a few "draft" policies that should be embraced by all companies worldwide.</p>

<h2>Name Policy</h2>

<p>The name of an individual is a <strong>core part of their identity</strong> and their personality, 
and everyone should be allowed to choose their elected name to use for work.</p>

<p>In particular for transgender people this is important as using the <strong>deadname</strong> is extremely <strong>painful</strong> for them - 
it causes extreme <strong>discomfort</strong> if not even <strong>depression</strong>.</p>

<p>It is important to allow people to have <strong>emails, accounts and documents in their elected name</strong>, whenever possibile, 
and to reclude the "legal" name to only situation in which is strictly required.</p>

<h2>Bathroom policy</h2>

<p><strong>Everyone should be able to use the bathroom they feel more comfortable in</strong>, 
transgender women should be allowed in women only spaces and transgender men should be allowed in men only spaces.</p>

<p>Cis-women who are afraid of trans-women in women spaces are actually afraid of men, without understanding 
that trans-women are women too and are afraid of men too.</p>

<p>Allowing this fear to drive the "bathroom policy" and not allowing trans people in their true gender's 
bathroom only <strong>allows transphobia to proliferate and discriminates even further a marginalised group of society</strong>.</p>

<p>Is also important to provide <strong>gender-neutral bathrooms</strong> where anyone can enter <strong>without discrimination</strong>, 
this will not only help gender non-conforming and gender-questioning people, but also help <strong>eradicate the fear of a predator being in a bathroom</strong>.</p>

<p>If there's space, consider also adding a <strong>shower room</strong> to allow people who come with bicycles, 
walking or other body-intensive activity, to take a shower and change their clothes before starting to work.</p>

<h2>Discrimination policy</h2>

<p><strong>Discrimination in the workplace reduces revenue</strong>. Every business owner should know that. 
Any employee who discriminate based on sex, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, 
gender identity and/or disability should face serious consequences: if they're left doing harm, 
they will make your workforce flee to the competition, and with them, your business secrets.</p>

<p>I have personally heard stories of bosses saying to their employees stuff like 
"<em><strong>You should not come out in the office, it is like coming with a purple crest on your hair</strong></em>" 
at a transgender woman who just had the courage to assert her identity in the workplace. 
This has caused <strong>serious depression</strong> to the poor woman, 
and felt like <strong>nobody cared about her</strong> and that she should just <strong>leave the company</strong>.</p>

<h2>Childcare policy</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, non married couples, LGBTQIA+ couples or polyamorous polycules <strong>do not get legal recognition of their children</strong>, 
if they were not "actively" involved into making them (adoption, foster care, IVF, etc...).</p>

<p>An <strong>inclusive company should recognise</strong> this and help those families by recognising those 
children that the law won't recognise. Give your employees the <strong>right to time off to take care of their children</strong>, 
to bring them or take them from school and other activities, as if they were legally recognised by law, 
this will allow for a happier and healthier workplace.</p>

<h2>Education policy</h2>

<p>All <strong>employees and business owners</strong> should be educated about <strong>what being LGBTQIA+ means</strong>, 
especially about trans people. There's still a lot of <strong>stigma</strong> around transgender people, 
thinking that transgender people are only female looking <strong>AMAB</strong> individuals who performs the oldest job in the world. 
There is also a lot of <strong>confusion</strong> about the difference between a <strong>drag queen</strong>, a <strong>transgender woman</strong> and a <strong>transvestite</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li>a Transgender woman is a woman, period.</li>
<li>a Drag Queen is a character, non the person behind the character, who performs with extreme makenpm rup and dresses.</li>
<li>a Transvestite, or crossdresser, is a person who enjoys dressing in what is considered other gender's clothes, 
this could be a man, knowing he is a man, with feminine clothes or a woman, knowing she is a woman, with masculine clothes.</li>
</ol>
